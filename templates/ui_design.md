# UI Document
The UI Design document, as the name implies, is a document that contains all of the information about the design of the UI, including the organization of the menus, the art, and the feedback each option is going to provide. This document is going to give a general template on how to create a menu.

## Creating a Menu
When creating the menu, the first step is to identify what is the purpose of that specific menu. Once answering this question, it is easier to know what options should be available for the player to click on. It is key to keep things as logical and organized as possible, with no clutter or areas that can be confusing. For example, for a main menu, the most common options are:

* __Play:__ where the player can choose to start a new game or load a previous game.
* __Settings:__ where the player can adjust the settings of the game.
* __Credits:__ where information about the developers and the license used is displayed.
* __Exit:__ where the player can exit the game.

Obviously there are different options that can be added, like instead of __Play__ it can be __New Game__ or __Load Game__. It all depends on your preferences and the game that is going to be developed. 

Another example can be the settings, which can have the following options:

* __General/Gameplay__
* __Graphics__ 
* __Controls__ 
* __Audio__ 
* __Back__

In this case, the player has different sections where she or he can adjust the settings in the video game, each section containing different options to be adjusted. It is also important to add a button or some sort of information that lets the player go back to the main menu, or pause menu (depending where they come from), in order to navigate well through the menus.


## Flowcharts
Flowcharts are going to be key in order to make sure the navigation through the menus is as efficient and organized as possible. Flowcharts lets see visually in a very simple way the setup for our menus. It is going to be important to create flowcharts to demostrate and make sure that the organization is as best as possible.

Some examples:

Also, developers can create a generic flowchart that is going to show the flow between all of the menus:

## Interaction and Art
Once having the organization and flow of the menus decided, it is important to think about the feedback the player is going to recieve. You can ask yourself the following questions:

- What style do I want? 
- Does clicking each option going to have an audio or visual feedback?
- Is there any elements that can be removed to ensure clarity and a better organization?
- Are the actions available to the player clear?
- Is there going to be any feedback when the player hovers the mouse or controller over an option?


## Steps on Creating a Menu
In summary, these are the list of steps that your team can do when creating a menu:

1. Choose what menus your game is going to have.

Our game is going to have the following menus:
- _type1_
- _type2_
- _type3_
- _etc_

For each menu, you will have to do the following steps:

2. Identify what options should be given in this menu.

In the _type of menu_, these are the options that are going to be available for the player:
-
-
-
-

3. Make a flowchart between menus, with every action available.

For the _type of menu_, this is the flowchart we created:

5. Specify any visual or audio feedback for each menu.
