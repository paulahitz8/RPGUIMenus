# RPG UI Menus
# Introduction
Since the beginning of the gaming era, the UI of a game miau miau miau. 

## UI vs UX
The terms UI and UX are often used incorrectly due to the lack of understanding of their actual meaning. UI, or _User Interface_, in video games is the way in which the player interacts with the game through methods, like the controller or keyboard, and interfaces, like the menus or HUD. 
On the other hand UX, or _User Experience_, refers to how enjoyable or intuitive these interactions actually are. It is also important to clarify that the HUD, or _Head-Up-Display_ is the method in which the game visually displays the information to the player, being part of the game's UI.

## Why is it important to have a good UI?
The goal of a good UI is to provide information to the user in a clear and quick way, avoiding distractions or innecessary information. After some research, I found a good list of questions that can ensure a well use of the UI. These are the following:
1. Does this interface tell me what I need to know _right now_?
2. Is it easy to find the information I am looking for?
3. Can I use this interface intuitively?
4. Are the things I am able to do on this screen obvious?
5. Is there any unnecessary information on the screen?
6. Are there any repetitive tasks that I can shorten?

It is important to frequently ask these questions when developing a video game to avoid any complications or unpleasant experiences.
