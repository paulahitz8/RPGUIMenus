# RPG UI Menus
# Introduction
Since the beginning of the gaming era, the UI of a game miau miau miau. 

## UI vs UX
The terms UI and UX are often used incorrectly due to the lack of understanding of their actual meaning. UI, or User Interface, in video games is the way in which the player interacts with the game through methods, like the controller or keyboard, and interfaces, like the menus or HUD. On the other hand, UX, or User Experience, refers to how enjoyable or intuitive these interactions actually are. It is also important to clarify that the HUD, or Head-Up-Display, is the method in which the game visually displays the information to the player, being part of the game’s UI.

## Why is it important to have a good UI?
The goal of a good UI is to provide information to the user in a clear and quick way, avoiding distractions or unnecessary information. After some research I found a good list of questions that can ensure a good use of the UI. These are the following:

1. Does this interface tell me what I need to know right now?
2. Is it easy to find the information I am looking for?
3. Can I use this interface intuitively?
4. Are the things I am able to do on this screen obvious?
5. Is there any unnecessary information on the screen?
6. Are there any repetitive tasks that I can shorten?

It is important to frequently ask these questions when designing and developing a video game in order to avoid any complications or unpleasant experiences.

## Flowchart
When designing the UI of the video game, there is a very common technique called the flowchart. This technique consists of designing a diagram that represents the different actions that the player can take while navigating through the different menus. This can help to ensure a logical and efficient way to access different information provided by the videogame.

This is an example of a flowchart:

As you can see it displays the different menus and the arrows show how the player can navigate through this. The purpose of this is to make it as simple as possible, to avoid confusion and distraction. 

# Types of Menus and Examples
I wanted to do a disclaimer here: every game is different, it is impossible to find a structure that suits every game since all of them have different elements that make the game. Some games have very simple menus and others have very complex ones with a bunch of options that the player can use. I will be showing you the most common, some particular ones that I find interesting, and I organized them from my point of view. 

## Main Menu
The most basic menu that we can find in almost every game is the main menu. We often see it right when we open the game, giving us the option to play, go to our settings, quit the game etc. Some games have a lot more options, like...

## Pause Menu
What elements can we most likely find in the Pause Menu? 
- Continue
- Settings
- Exit

## Character Selection Menu
Where the player gets to decide which character she or he can play.

## Character Creation Menu
Where the player gets to create his or her character.

## Stats Menu
Where the different stats of the character are being displayed. They can vary depending on the game. Some elements found are:
- Health
- Stamina
- Armor
- Intelligence
- Weight

## Skills Menu
This menu displays the skills that are or can be obtained by the character. They can be displayed in different ways, like in a list. I believe the most common and efficient way to display it is in a tree.

## Inventory Menu
This menu displays the inventory of the character, which is basically what they are carrying in the game. 

## Equipment Menu
This menu can be often confused with the previous one, but it refers to the gear the character wears, like armor or weapons. It is sometimes linked to the inventory, since they are normally able to equip and unequip certain items.

## Settings Menu
This menu allows the player to change certain options of the game. The most common options are:
- General/Gameplay
  - Language
  - HUD settings
  - Text settings
  - Brightness
- Controls
  - Keybinds
  - Keyboard and mouse
  - Controller
  - Sensitivity
- Graphics
  - Display
  - Quality
- Audio
  - Master volume
  - Music volume
  - Fx volume

## Social Menu
Social menus are more often found in multiplayer games, but some games that are singleplayer still can offer some of these options. These are some submenus we can find here:
- Lobby
- Clan
- Matchmaking
- Party
- Friends list

## Quest Menu
Where the quests of the player are being displayed, often with some backstory and location. Normally, they are divided into main quests and optional or secondary quests. Main quests tend to follow the story of the game.

## Map Menu
Whether there is only one map or there are many worlds with different maps (like in Destiny), the Map Menu is where the world is being displayed, helping the player navigate around the different locations in the game. Sometimes, quests are signalized on the map, to make it easier for the player to understand where she or he needs to go.

## Crafting Menu
Crafting menus are somewhat common in RPG games. Sometimes they are linked to the inventory menu since we often need ingredients or pieces in order to craft certain objects.

## Achievements Menu
This menu is mostly used to show off to our friends what we achieved while playing. Also, it is very satisfying to complete everything, at least for some players. 

## Collections Menu
This is similar to the menu before, but it is specifically objects you can collect in the game, like for example in World of Warcraft you can collect different mounts and pets.

## Store Menu
Whether it’s a store with real money or in-game money, this is used to make the player spend money. With real money we can buy things like skins, special objects in the game, exclusive content etc. With in-game money we can often buy power-ups, better gear etc. But actually, the options are limitless. 

## News or Patch Notes Menu
This menu is also self explanatory. Here the game gives information to the player like about new updates or events that might be coming up. These are normally very common in multiplayer RPGs since they are constantly tweaking the games and adding more events for people to participate in.

## Saving Slots Menu
This is another menu that can be found in singleplayer games, where the player can save his or her progression during that game. 

## Player(s) Name Input Menu
I believe this menu is very specific, but it can be found also in RPG games, especially the old school ones. This menu is dedicated for the player to introduce his or her name.

# HUD and Dialog
One of the most common elements found in video games is the HUD, where relevant information is displayed on screen for the player to use while playing. There are many different types of HUDs depending on what the developers are going for:

Examples and descriptions

# Evolution
It is very interesting how all of these elements have evolved along the years, for example (3 digit example). Here we go into the topic of old school vs new school games and UI has evolved during the years.

## Old School Games

## New School Games
